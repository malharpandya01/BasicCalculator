# BasicCalculator
This calculator can do basic operations of two numbers (multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.)

Just enter whatever integer you want for the first and second numbers.
And enter +, -, *, or / for the operation you want perform.

If there's an "Error" message, it means you didn't enter one of the four operation signs, so just run the program again and enter +, -, *, or /.

Thats it. :)
